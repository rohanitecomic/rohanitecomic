            <h3>Yo, Rohanite here.</h3>
            <p>This is my first fully realized webcomic, Dandelion, a story about a girl who just wants to do what she can with her rather limited skill set. I draw completely traditionally so art supplies are a constant investment, and time even more so, if you enjoy what you've seen and would like to support my endeavours, check out https://www.patreon.com/rohanite. Hope you enjoy your stay, thanks!</p>
